# cancer_detection
This cancer detection classifier is created using a dataset which contains 569 samples of tumors, each containing 30 features. 60% of the whole dataset is used for training the classifier, the rest is used as testing dataset to verify its performance. Multiple principal component analysis was performed on the dataset, and for each configuration the best parameters were searched. It was found that the SVM classifier shows superior performance using a linear kernel on 11 principal components. The training set accuracy is 97.36%, but the test set shows an accuracy of 99.12%. It also shows a good precision and recall, each having 98.75%.  The details of hyper parameters and accuracy found of other number of principal components are provided in txt files.
